# JavaScript Recursive Fibonacci Stack Overflow

This repository demonstrates a common performance issue in recursive functions: stack overflow errors. The `bug.js` file contains a recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence that suffers from this problem.  The solution in `bugSolution.js` demonstrates how to mitigate this using dynamic programming.  This approach avoids redundant calculations and prevents stack overflow errors.

## How to run the code

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` in your favorite JavaScript editor or IDE.
3. Run the files in a JavaScript environment (browser console, Node.js, etc.).  Observe the performance difference.  For larger inputs, you will only see the result from the dynamic programming solution.
